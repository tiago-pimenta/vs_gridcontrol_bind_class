# vs_gridcontrol_bind_class

Hi,

Objectives of this Example

1. Connect the DevExpress GridControl (v. 19.2.5.0) to a class (Record.cs) and list all the records when I run the system (Windows Forms).

2. Be able to insert, update and delete the records in execution mode

If you can help me, I thank you, because I'm starting with C # and DevExpress

Thanks
